# Code Refactor Starter Code

Description: fixed nav bar links (made logo redirect to homepage), replaced non-semantic HTML with semantic HTML, consolidated CSS to avoid redundant code, adjusted line-height for content section to match mock-up, added overflow and width properties to content section to confine elements to each individual box, adjusted benefits box using line-height and margin to match-mock up, added overflow property to header to confine elements.

I want to note that I feel like something is slightly off with the size/spacing of the text in the content section, but I'm not sure if it's related to screen size or the code itself.
